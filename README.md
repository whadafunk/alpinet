# NETWORK TOOLS CONTAINER

## A little bit more than the standard official alpine container

*I have added a couple of networking tools and sshd to the standard alpine image and that's that this container is all about*

## Tools

- iproute2
- openssh server
- openssh client
- tcpdump
- nmap
- netcat
- net-tools
- vim
- tmux
- mc

## Instructions

*The container is starting sshd and uses the config files from this directory*

To authenticate to ssh you can use the following credentials:

admin / pass123
